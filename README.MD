## Feature
- It will be trigger when NSB blue tasks create some tasks.
- The yellow tasks will auto deleted by this program after 5 minutes.
- This program was setted 5 minutes and you can't edit it for now.
- It only will trigger one time every 5 minutes.

## Something explain:
- When the tasks deleted,the NSB will `shutdown` to reload the tasks list, so maybe it will cause some tasks not running for 5 minutes.

## ENJOY!

- The yellow tasks will auto deleted by this program after 5 minutes.
- This program was setted 5 minutes and you can't edit it for now.

## issues
- When the tasks deleted,the NSB will close to reload the tasks list,so maybe it will cause some tasks not running for 5 minutes,I will try to handle it but I'm not sure I can.
